# Content.AI-Backend  

## Transcribe and Create Content from Videos

Content.AI is a fullstack application that transcribes videos into text, with functionalities to create Summaries, YouTube Titles, YouTube Descriptions, TikTok and Instagram Descriptions, as well as fully transcribing a video.

This application uses technologies like TypeScript, React.js, Prisma, Node.js, and the video transcription engine from OpenAI. It also utilizes the Shacn UI library for components and styling, as well as the ffmpeg.wasm library, which is a WebAssembly library for manipulating media in client-side applications without the need for a backend or plugins.
